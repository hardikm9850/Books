## 🚀 Summary

Peter Senge’s *The Fifth Discipline* introduces the idea of the **“learning organization”**, where teams continually grow and adapt by mastering five core disciplines. The fifth — **Systems Thinking** — binds the rest, enabling organizations and individuals to see the “whole picture” and make smarter, lasting change.

This book is foundational for leadership, team-building, and long-term organizational transformation.
