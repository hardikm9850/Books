## 🚀 Summary

*Make It Stick* challenges conventional beliefs about how learning works. Drawing on cognitive psychology, it presents **evidence-based learning techniques** that are far more effective than passive re-reading or cramming.

The central theme is: **learning that feels hard is often more effective**, while **learning that feels easy can be deceptive**.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Retrieval Practice**: Actively recalling what you’ve learned strengthens memory far more than reviewing notes.
- **Spacing Effect**: Space out learning sessions — long-term retention improves when learning is distributed over time.
- **Interleaving**: Mix different types of problems or subjects. It feels harder but improves your ability to apply knowledge.
- **Elaboration**: Explain ideas in your own words, connect them to what you already know.
- **Generation**: Try solving a problem before being taught the solution — the struggle helps embed the concept deeper.
- **Reflection**: Regularly reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what you can improve.

## 🔑 Top 5 Takeaways

1. **Struggle is desirable** – If learning feels too easy, you're probably not retaining it.
2. **Self-testing is better than re-reading** – Use flashcards, quizzes, or the Feynman technique to practice retrieval.
3. **Spacing and interleaving** – Learning multiple topics or revisiting material after time gaps builds stronger understanding.
4. **Learning styles are a myth** – Tailoring teaching to "visual" or "auditory" learners shows little evidence of benefit.
5. **Forget “cramming”** – It may help short-term but destroys long-term retention.

## 🧰 Actionable Insights

- 🧠 Use **spaced repetition tools** like Anki or manually schedule revision over increasing intervals.
- ✍️ Practice **active recall**: don’t look at notes — try to write out or explain what you remember.
- 🔄 Mix topics during study instead of batching similar types of problems (e.g., math word problems + algebra).
- 🗣️ Teach someone else what you learned using simple language.
- 📓 Keep a **learning journal** to reflect on key lessons and how you applied them.
